  <h1>Notes on recursion</h1>

</div>

<div class="box">

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    These notes give an overview of <i>fixed points</i>, a core programming language features used
    to explain recursive definition.
  </p>

  <h2>Approximating recursive functions</h2>

  <p>
    One way we can attempt to understand what a recursive definition means is to consider
    a <i>series of approximations</i> to the definition.  For example, consider the standard
    definition of the factorial function, as expressed in our &lambda;-calculus:
  </p>

  <pre>fact = &lambda; n. if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1)</pre>

  <p>
    We want to construct a series of approximations to the <code>fact</code> function.  Each
    approximation will be able to do one more recursive call than the approximation before it.  We
    can start with the version that makes no recursive calls:
  </p>

  <pre>fact<sub>0</sub> = &lambda; n. if n = 0 then 1 else <font color="red">error</font></pre>

  <p>
    This approximates the <code>fact</code> function when it makes no recursive calls; I have
    used <code><font color="red">error</font></code> to indicate cases that we have not yet
    approximated.  We could replace <code><font color="red">error</font></code> with any integer
    value; the point is simply to indicate that, whatever value we choose, it is not a correct
    approximation of the result of <code>fact</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next version of <code>fact</code> that we can approximate is the version that makes one (or
    fewer) recursive calls.  This version will rely on the previous approxmation to handle the
    recursion:
  </p>

  <pre>fact<sub>1</sub> = &lambda; n. if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact<sub>0</sub> (n - 1)</pre>

  <p>
    Observe two things about this code.  First: <code>fact<sub>1</sub></code> handles both the cases
    with 0 and 1 recursive calls.  Second: none of our definitions so far use recursion.  Other than
    how to implement <code>error</code> (really, anything will do), there are no mysteries about how
    any of these functions work.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can continue in the same vein, building deeper and deeper approximations of
    the <code>fact</code> function:
  </p>

  <pre>fact<sub>n+1</sub> = &lambda; n. if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact<sub>n</sub> (n - 1)</pre>

  <p>
    Now, we can observe that, for any program we can write, there is a value of <i>n</i> large
    enough that <code>fact<sub>n</sub></code> is indistinguishable from the recursive definition
    of <code>fact</code>.  For example, if the largest argument we ever pass to <code>fact</code> is
    256, then <code>fact<sub>256</sub></code> is a good enough approximation.  Of course, so
    is <code>fact<sub>257</sub></code>, or <code>fact<sub>1024</sub></code>, and so forth.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, this is a little unsatisfactory&mdash;we would like our formal understanding
    of <code>fact</code> to match our intuitive understanding, and our intuitive understanding works
    for all inputs, not just inputs up to some pre-defined threshold.  To get a more satisfying
    understanding, we have to introduce a little bit of mathematics.
  </p>

  <h2>Fixed points</h2>

  <p>
    The key idea we need to steal from mathematics is that of a <i>fixed point</i>.  The short
    version is that, for some function $f(x)$, $c$ is a fixed point of $f$ iff $f(c) = c$.  Not
    every function has a fixed point; for example, the there is no integer fixed point for the
    function $f(x) = x + 1$.  On the other hand, many functions do have fixed points; for example,
    $0$ is the fixed point of the sine function.
  </p>

  <p>
    How can this help us?  Well, we can start by describing our series of appoximations
    to <code>fact</code> themselves as a function; that is, we want a function <code>factStep</code>
    such that <code>factStep fact<sub>n</sub></code> gives <code>fact<sub>n+1</sub></code>.  This is
    not too hard to do.
  </p>

  <pre>factStep = &lambda; f. &lambda; n. if n = 0 then 1 else n * f (n - 1)</pre>

  <p>
    You should be able to satisfy yourself that <code>factStep fact<sub>0</sub></code>
    is <code>fact<sub>1</sub></code>, <code>factStep (factStep fact<sub>0</sub>)</code>
    is <code>fact<sub>2</sub></code>, and so forth.  The question we then have to ask is:
    does <code>factStep</code> have a fixed point?  That is, is there a
    function <code>fact<sub>&omega;</sub></code> such that <code>factStep
    fact<sub>&omega;</sub></code> is <code>fact<sub>&omega;</sub></code>?  Thanks to the
    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_fixed-point_theorem><i>Kleene fixed-point
    theorems</i></a>, one of the more significant results in the mathematics of computation, we know
    that, not only does this function have a fixed point, but it is exactly the one obtained by
    iterating the function.  That is to say, <code>fact<sub>&omega;</sub></code> is exactly the
    result of <code>factStep (factStep (factStep ... (factStep fact<sub>0</sub>)))</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, suppose that <code>fact</code> is defined by iterating <code>factStep</code>.  How
    would <code>fact 3</code> behave?  Well, because <code>fact</code> is the fixed point
    of <code>factStep</code>, we know that <code>face</code> is equal to <code>factStep fact</code>.
    So <code>fact 3</code> should be equal to <code>factStep fact 3</code>.  We can substitute into
    the definition of <code>factStep</code>, getting <code>if isz 3 then 1 else 3 * fact (3 -
    1)</code>, and so forth.  Evaluating, we get to <code>3 * fact 2</code>, and we have gotten to
    the next recursive call, as we expect.
  </p>

  <h2>Generalizing fixed point construction</h2>

  <p>
    Hopefully, you found this brief journey into the mathematics of fixed points interesting, even
    if perhaps not entirely understandable.  What is important, however, is that it has given us a
    mechanical way of explaining recursion.  That is, rather than considering recursive definitions,
    such as the one given for <code>fact</code> earlier, we can define recursion using fixed points
    of step functions, such as <code>factStep</code>.  That is to say, we want to introduce an
    explicit fixed point construct <code>fix</code> to our &lambda;-calculus.  Then, we can
    factorial by
  </p>

  <pre>
let factStep = &lambda; f. &lambda; n. if n = 0 then 1 else n * f (n - 1) in
let fact = fix factStep in
  (fact 3, fact 5)
</pre>

  <p>
    And, the same construct can be used to define arbitrary other recursive functions.  For example,
    the Fibonacci numbers
  </p>

  <pre>
let fibStep = &lambda; f. &lambda; n.
  if isz n then 0
  else if isz (n - 1) then 1
  else f (n - 1) + f (n - 2) in
let fib = fix fibStep in
  (fib 3, fib 5)
</pre>

  <p>
    In fact, you could even define the type checking and evaluation functions we write in class
    using fixed points (albeit, in a slightly more complicated &lambda;-calculus that we have built
    so far).  Evaluation might begin as follows:
  </p>

  <pre>
let evalStep = &lambda; eval. &lambda; t.
  case t of
    Const x -> VInt x
  | Plus t1 t2 ->
      let VInt v1 = eval e1 in
      let VInt v2 = eval e2 in
        VInt (v1 + v2)
  ... in
let eval = fix evalStep in
  ...</pre>

  <p>
    <code>evalStep</code> is more complicated than <code>factStep</code> or <code>fibStep</code>,
    but the basic idea is the same: <code>evalStep</code> computes the next iteration of the
    evaluation function from the previous one.  So, the fixed point of <code>evalStep</code> will be
    the recursive evaluation function.  (You may recognize <code>evalStep</code> as being similar to
    the <a href="Lcst3.hs">generic evaluation function</a> we built in class recently.  This should
    not be surprising; there, as here, our concern was the structure of recursion.)
  </p>

  <h2>Formalizing <code>fix</code></h2>

  <p>
    To finish our discussion of fixed points, we want to introduce typing and evaluation rules for
    the <code>fix</code> term.  We can make a first attempt based on translating the intuitive idea
    of a fixed point; that is, that if expression <code>e</code> is a stepping function (of
    type <code>t -> t</code>), then <code>fix e</code> should be the result of iterating that
    function (of type <code>t</code>):
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \frac{\Gamma \vdash e : t \to t}
         {\Gamma \vdash \mathtt{fix} \, e : t}
    \qquad \qquad
    \frac{e \, (\mathtt{fix} \, e) \Downarrow v}
         {\mathtt{fix} \, e \Downarrow v}
  </script>

  <p>
    If you check the definitions earlier in this file, you should see that they are accepted by this
    typing rule.  The evaluation rule seems to capture the intuition of fixed points.  And, if our
    &lambda;-calculus were a <i>call-by-name</i> calculus, like Haskell, we would be done.  (In
    fact, you can observe that this is all you need in Haskell; look at the definitions
    in <a href="Fix.hs">Fix.hs</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    However, our &lambda;-calculus is <i>call-by-value</i> instead.  And that means to compute the
    result of an application (like <code>e (fix e)</code>), we need to evaluate both the function
    (<code>e</code>) <i>and the argument</i> (<code>fix e</code>).  However, this seems to leave us
    back where we started: to determine the value of <code>fix e</code>, we need to already have the
    value of <code>fix e</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can find our way out of this nest by making another observation.  All of the values for which
    we have wanted fixed points are themselves functions.  How does this help?  It means that we can
    assume that the result of <code>fix e</code> will be applied to at least one more argument, and
    so we can delay the evaluation of the <code>fix e</code> until we see that argument.
    Concretely, instead of the equation
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \mathtt{fix}\,e = e \, (\mathtt{fix}\,e)
  </script>

  <p>
    we will have the equation
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \mathtt{fix}\,e\,x = e \, (\mathtt{fix}\,e) \, x
  </script>

  <p>
    or, equivalently,
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \mathtt{fix}\,e = \lambda x. e \, (\mathtt{fix}\,e) \, x
  </script>

  <p>
    Hopefully you can see how this fixes the problem: because functions are themselves values, the
    evalutation of <code>fix t</code> stops immediately.  On the other hand, when applied to its
    next argument, it will evaluate as before.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can update our typing and evaluation rules to reflect the restriction of fixed points to
    functions, as follows.
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \frac{\Gamma \vdash e : (t_1 \to t_2) \to (t_1 \to t_2)}
         {\Gamma \vdash \mathtt{fix}\, e : t_1 \to t_2}
    \qquad \qquad
    \frac{ }
         {\mathtt{fix}\, e \Downarrow \lambda x. e \, (\mathtt{fix}\,e) \, x}
  </script>

  <p>
    And now we have the final (for now) account of recursion in our &lambda;-calculus.  Because we
    have limited recursion to functions, it is not quite as expressive as it is in Haskell.  For
    example, we cannot write the infinite streams of names used in homework 2.  But, for most
    practical purposes, this is not a significant restriction.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    The study of recursion is one of the more intricate parts of programming language theory.  These
    notes have given you an introduction to one way of describing and reasoning about recursion.
    There is still plenty to come.  For example, while we have a way to talk about recursively
    defined <i>values</i>, we have equally come to rely on recursively defined <i>types</i>.  We
    will return to these topics later in the course.
