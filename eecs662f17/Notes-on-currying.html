  <h2>Functions with multiple arguments</h2>

  <p>
    At this point in the course, we're collecting many of the building blocks of a simple
    programming language, the <em>simply typed lambda calculus</em> or STLC.  However, many of them
    may seem too simple to actually correspond to real programming languages.  For example, our
    functions can only operate on single arguments, whereas functions in real programming languages
    operate on many arguments at a time.  In this note, I'll talk about two ways we can represent
    multiple-argument functions in STLC, and we'll see that these ways are actually equivalent (or,
    if you prefer, interconvertable).
  </p>

  <h2>Tuples of arguments</h2>

  <p>
    One approach to expressing functions of multiple arguments is to use product types to compact
    multiple "intuitive" arguments into a single actual argument.  For a simple example, consider a
    function that adds three numbers.  In a language like C or Java, this function might be written
    as follows.
  </p>

  <pre>
int f(int x, int y, int z) {
  return x + y + z;
}</pre>

  <p>
    We think of this as a single function <code>f</code> with three arguments, <code>x</code>,
    <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>.  That is, we must apply this function to three arguments,
    and when we do it will produce a result.  The most direct way we can express such a function in
    our language is to use <em>products</em> to combine multiple individual arguments into a single
    compound argument.  For example, we could write a function in STLC that takes a tuple of
    arguments <code>(int * int) * int -> int</code> as follows
  </p>

  <pre>
\p : (int * int) * int ->
  let (q, z) = p in
  let (x, y) = q in
    x + y + z</pre>

  <p>
    We have defined a function which must be given three arguments (packaged in product types), and
    then immediately computes their sum.  If we call the function above <code>f<sub>1</sub></code>,
    then a sample evaluation of this function would go something as follows:
  </p>

  <pre>
f<sub>1</sub> ((1, 2), 3)
          --->
let (q, z) = ((1,2), 3) in
let (x, y) = q in
  x + y + z
          --->
let (x, y) = (1, 2) in
  x + y + 3
          --->
1 + 2 + 3
          --->
6
</pre>

  <p>
    Hopefully this corresponds to your intuition of how a multi-argument function "ought" to work
    (albeit with some extra boilerplate surrounding the use of tuples).
  </p>

  <h2>Functions returning functions</h2>

  <p>
    However, you may have noticed that this doesn't seem to be the way that Haskell treats
    multi-argument functions.  Indeed, it isn't.  There's an alternative approach,
    called <em>currying</em>, which is what's actually used in Haskell (and several other functional
    languages).  A curried function is essentially a nest of functions; each nested function
    collects one more argument until all the arguments have been collected.  For example, we could
    also write our 3-argument addition function as follows.
  </p>

  <pre>
\x : int ->
  (\y : int ->
     (\z: int -> x + y + z))</pre>

  <p>
    Here, the outermost function collects the value of parameter <code>x</code>, the next function
    collects the value of parameter <code>y</code>, while the innermost function collects the value
    of parameter <code>z</code> and computes the result.  If we call this
    function <code>f<sub>2</sub></code>, then a sample evaluation of this function would go
    something as follows.
  </p>

  <pre>
((f<sub>2</sub> 1) 2) 3
          --->
((\y : int -> (\z : int -> 1 + y + z)) 2) 3
          --->
(\z : int -> 1 + 2 + z) 3
          --->
1 + 2 + 3
          --->
6</pre>

  <p>
    The curried view may not immediately correspond to your intuition about how multi-argument
    functions should operate.  However, hopefully this example convinces you that it's actually
    doing the same thing!
  </p>

  <h2>A note on syntax</h2>

  <p>
    Haskell employs various syntactic abbreviations to make writing and using curried functions
    natural.  For example, when you write a Haskell function that seems to have multiple arguments:
  </p>

  <pre>
f x y z = x + y + z</pre>

  <p>
    Haskell actually interprets that definition as if it were defining a nest of three lambdas.  You
    can see this if you ask for the type, which Haskell well render as something like <code>Int ->
    Int -> Int</code>. When reading this type, remember that Haskell groups function arrows to the
    right, so that type is equivalent to <code>Int -> (Int -> Int)</code>. Similarly, when you write
    a function application like <code>map f xs</code>, Haskell automatically groups applications to
    the left, so that is equivalent to writing <code>(map f) xs</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>Currying and uncurrying</h2>

  <p>
    Now, we have two apparently equivalent approaches to multi-argument functions: the curried
    version, in which functions are actually nests of functions, and the uncurried version, in which
    functions take tuples of arguments.  The next question that should arise is whether one of these
    versions is more expressive than the other.  That is to say, can we write functions in a curried
    style that we could not write in an uncurried style, or vice-versa?
  </p>

  <p>
    In fact, we cannot.  To provide a "formal" argument that we can't, we'll write functions that
    convert between the curried and uncurried versions of a given function.  To start, let's
    consider the type of the "currying" function, which takes an uncurried function and returns its
    curried variant.
  </p>

  <pre>((a * b) -> c) -> (a -> (b -> c))</pre>

  <p>
    I've gone a little outside of our STLC language here by writing abstract
    types <code>a,b,c</code> instead of concrete types like <code>Int</code> or <code>Bool</code>.
    At this point, you should view these as "slots" in my explanation, into which you (the reader)
    could plug arbitrary types.  Later in the semester, we'll see how to capture this notion of
    abstract types within our language.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, let's attempt to define a function of this type.  STLC has very little syntax around, so
    most of our choices are determined by the type.  In particular, we're supposed to start out
    creating a function that takes something of type <code>(a * b) -> c</code>, so we'd better start
    out with a lambda: <code>\ f : ((a * b) -> c) -> ...</code>  We need to produce a return value
    of type <code>a -> (b -> c)</code>.  Again, the only syntactic form available to us is lambdas,
    so we'll have a few more of them: <code> \ f : ((a * b) -> c) -> (\x : a -> (\y -> b ->
    ...</code>  Finally, we need to produce a value of type <code>c</code>.  For any
    concrete <code>c</code>, like <code>Int</code> or <code>Bool</code>, I would have some idea how
    to produce such a value.  But I'm trying to make a generic argument, where you get to pick which
    types go in <code>a, b, c</code>.  This means that the only way I could make a value of
    type <code>c</code> is to call the function <code>f</code>.  The complete code for the currying
    function is as follows:
  </p>

<pre>
\ f : ((a * b) -> c) ->
  (\x : a ->
     (\y -> b ->
        f (x, y)</pre>

   <p>
     Of course, we can also go the other way, and write an uncurrying function with the following
     type.
   </p>

   <pre>(a -> (b -> c)) -> ((a * b) -> c)</pre>

   <p>
     As for the currying function, our choices in writing this function are mostly determined by the
     type we'd like the result to have.  I'll leave you to go through the details, but the end
     result should be:
   </p>

<pre>
\f : (a -> (b -> c)) ->
  (\p : (a * b) ->
     let (x, y) = p in
       f x y)</pre>

  <p>
    At this point, it may not be entirely obvious that we've done the right thing.  Perhaps an
    example will help.  Let's name the currying function <code>curry</code>, and let's also
    introduce a function to curry.  Here's a simple one.
  </p>

<pre>
add = \p : int * int ->
        let (x, y) = p in x + y</pre>

  <p>
    Now, if our currying function does what it's supposed to do, we should be able to use it to
    curry the <code>add</code> function.  Let's see how the reduction works out.  Note that I'll
    leave the <code>add</code> function un-expanded as long as possible, just to avoid symbol
    overload.
  </p>

<pre>
((curry add) 2) 3
          --->
(((\f : ((Int * Int) -> Int) -> (\x : Int -> (\y : Int -> f (x, y)))) add) 2) 3
          --->
((\x : Int -> (\y : Int -> add (x, y))) 2) 3
          --->
(\y : Int -> add (2, y)) 3
          --->
add (2, 3)</pre>

  <p>
    We could continue the evaluation of <code>add (2, 3)</code>, but we don't need to.  We've
    already seen that currying has turned a curried function call into an uncurried one.
  </p>

  <p class="exercise">
    <em>Optional exercise.</em> Define a curried addition function <code>add<sub>2</sub></code> function, and then confirm
    that <code>uncurry add<sub>2</sub> (1,2)</code> works as you'd expect.
  </p>

  <p class="exercise">
    <em>Optional exercise:</em> The <code>uncurry</code> function is itself curried!  Understand that
    statement, and then write an uncurried version of the uncurry function.  Confirm that you get
    the same result if you evaluate <code>uncurry uncurry</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>Equivalence</h2>

  <p>
    So now, in addition to having two different views of multi-argument functions, we also have
    functions that convert between these two views.  What have we learned?
  </p>

  <p>
    For one, we've learned that there aren't any functions we can write one way that we couldn't
    write the other way.  Suppose we thought that we had a curried function <code>f</code> which
    couldn't be written uncurried.  The counterexample is immediate: <code>uncurry f</code> computes
    the uncurried version of function <code>f</code>.  More generally, we can think of these
    functions as proving that the curried and uncurried functions are in some sense "the same".
    That is, every uncurried function corresponds to exactly one curried function, and vice versa.
    (For an analogy, think of how cartesian and polar coordinates each describe exactly the same 2-d
    plane.)
  </p>

  <p>
    This is an example of a pervasive technique in the study of programming languages.  We'll
    frequently want to compare the expressiveness of different language features; that is, to ask
    whether we can express more programs using one feature than another, or to ask whether some
    feature actually extends the expressiveness of a language or just makes it easier to use.  One
    way to answer these questions is to define mappings between the features, just as we've done
    here with multi-argument functions, or to show that such mappings can't be defined.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the semester goes on, we'll see more and more examples of languages features and mappings
    between them.
  </p>

  <h2>Why curry?</h2>

  <p>
    You may still be left wondering about the point.  What's the value of having two different ways
    of viewing multi-argument functions?  Are we better off now than we were when we just had
    multi-argument functions, as in C or Java?
  </p>

  <p>
    The first answer is that curried functions can be more flexible.  Many examples of more advanced
    functional programming, particularly in Haskell, rely on currying to describe computations (or
    pipelines of computation).  There are several examples of this in
    the <a href="Hw0Solutions.hs">sample solutions to homework 0</a> (look in particular around uses
    of the function composition operator <code>.</code>).
  </p>

  <p>
    The second answer is that currying and uncurrying is one of the simplest examples
    of <em>higher-order</em> functional programming---that is to say, programming that manipulates
    functions, not just values.  By studying simple examples of higher-order functional programming,
    it will hopefully be easier to understand more complicated examples as they come along later in
    the semester.
  </p>

  <p>
    The third answer is that the curried versions of functions are, in a technical sense, simpler
    than the uncurried versions.  That is to say: uncurried functions are defined in terms of two
    distinct ideas, functions and products, while curried functions require only the idea of
    functions.  Later in the semester, we'll see that with a bit more magic in our types, we'll be
    able to do away with the idea of products entirely.
