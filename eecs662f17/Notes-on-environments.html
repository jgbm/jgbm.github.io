  <h1>Notes on environments</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The fundamental idea in our operational account of the simply-typed &lamnda;-calculus
    is <i>substitution</i>.  However, in practice, substitution is an inefficient way to implement
    functional programming languages.  These notes will motivate an alternative view, based on the
    idea of <i>environments</i>, and discuss some historical alternatives to our standard notion of
    &lambda;-calculus reduction
  </p>

  <h2>Substitutions</h2>

  <p>
    We use substitution to describe the meaning of variables in the simply-typed &lambda;-calculus.
    For example, the reduction rule for application is as follows.
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \frac{e_1 \Eval \lambda x. e \quad
          e_2 \Eval w \quad
          [x \mapsto w] \, e \Eval v}
         {e_1 \, e_2 \Eval v}
  </script>

  <p>
    Intuitively, we read this rule as saying: "if $e_1$ reduces to $\lambda x. e$, and $e_2$ reduces
    to $w$, and $e$ with $x$ mapped to $w$ reduces to $v$, then $e_1 \, e_2$ reduces to $v$".  To
    understand what this means, we need some understanding of "$e$ with $x$ mapped to $w$".  This is
    the operation of substitution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our first approach to understanding substitution is to define it directly.  That is, we give a
    (recursive) definition of what it means to substitute a value $w$ for a variable $x$ in each
    possible &lambda;-calculus term.  Some terms, such as addition or application, do not manipulate
    variables directly, and so substitution can be defined simply.
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \begin{align*}
      [x \mapsto v]\, (e_1\,e_2) &= ([x \mapsto v]\,e_1) \, ([x \mapsto v]\,e_2) \\
      [x \mapsto v]\, (e_1 + e_2) &= [x \mapsto v]\,e_1 + [x \mapsto v]\,e_2
    \end{align*}
  </script>

  <p>
    The more interesting cases of substitution are to do with the introduction and use of variables,
    in lambda and variable terms.
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \begin{align*}
      [x \mapsto v] \, y &= \begin{cases}
        v &\text{if $x = y$} \\
        y &\text{otherwise}
      \end{cases} \\
      [x \mapsto v] \, (\backslash y : t. e) &= \begin{cases}
        \backslash y : t. e & \text{if $x = y$} \\
        \backslash y : t. [x \mapsto v] e & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
  </script>

  <p>
    The variable rule says that, if we are replacing $x$ by $w$, then we replace variables if they
    are $x$ and leave them alone otherwise.  The rule for functions is more interesting.  It says
    that, if we are attempting to replace a variable $x$, and we have a function that abstracts over
    a variable $x$, we stop substituting.  Intuitively, this is because the variable $x$ inside the
    function is a different variable than the variable $x$ which we are replacing.  If the function
    abstracts over a different variable, then we do continue replacing $x$ by $w$ in the body of the
    function.
  </p>

  <p>
    (An aside.  One conseqeunce of our treatment of variables is that the variable name used in a
    function expression can be changed at will.  That is, a function expression $\backslash y : t
    . e$ is exactly equivalent to $\backslash z : t . [y \mapsto z]\,e$.  This rule is frequently
    called &alpha;-equivalence.  Another way to account for the opreation of substitution on
    function terms is to assume that functions never reuse variables---which we can do safely,
    because we can always apply &alpha;-equivalence to turn a function that does reuse a variable
    name into one that does not.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Substitutions provide a simple, complete explanation of the behavior of the &lambda;-calculus,
    and we will continue to use them formally.  However, as an implementation technique, using
    substitution directly leaves much to be desired.  Each substitution operation has to
    (potentially) traverse the syntax of the entire expression.  Consequently, nested substitutions
    (such as might arise from nested applications, a common pattern in functional programming)
    result in repeated traversals of the target expression.
  </p>

  <h2>From substitutions to environments</h2>

  <p>
    Our alternative approach is based on the idea of <i>environments</i>.  Rather than apply
    substitutions immediately when they arise (such as in the application rule), we will maintain an
    environment mapping variables to values as we perform evaluation.  This is appealing from two
    perspectives.  First, it addresses the complexity of &lambda;-calculus evaluation: updating the
    environment can be done in constant time, and we only need to look up values in the environment
    at variables.  Second, it matches very closely with our idea of typing: just as in typing, we
    use an environment $\Gamma$ to match variables with types, now in evaluation we will use an
    environment $H$ to match variables with values.
  </p>

  <p>
    We start out by defining environments.  We define enviroments $H$ to be sequences of mappings
    from variables to values $x_1 \mapsto v_1, \dots, x_n \mapsto v_n$.  As with type environments
    $\Gamma$, we will extend environments $H$ by writing $H, x \mapsto v$.  Finally, we define
    $H(y)$, the value associated with $y$ in $H$, as the value <i>right-most</i> mapping of $y$.
    Formally,
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    (H,x \mapsto v)(y) = \begin{cases}
       v &\text{if $x = y$} \\
       H(y) &\text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  </script>

  <p>
    Next, we want to define evaluation rules that use the environment.  This means we need a new
    evaluation relation.  Where we previously treated evaluation as a two-place relation $e \Eval
    v$, where our expression $e$ sometimes was itself the result of substitution, we will now use a
    three-place relation $\HEval H e v$, where $H$ is an environment, $e$ is an expression, and $v$
    is a value.  Many of our evaluation rules do not use variables, and so adding the environment
    $H$ is trivial:
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \frac{\HEval H {e_1} {v_1} \quad
          \HEval H {e_2} {v_2}}
         {\HEval H {e_1 + e_2} {v_1 + v_2}}
  </script>

  <p>
    The interesting cases are all to do with the handling of variables.
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \frac{H(x) = v}
         {\HEval H x v}
    \qquad
    \frac{\HEval H {e_1} w \quad
          \HEval {H, x \mapsto w} {e_2} v}
         {\HEval H {\Let x {e_1} {e_2}} v}
  </script>

  <p>
    The rule for variables depends on their values in $H$; note that, if $H$ does not contain a
    binding for $x$, then $H(x)$ is undefined and so there is no $v$ for which you can construct a
    derivation of $\HEval H x v$.  The rule for let adds a new binding to $H$ when evaluating the
    body.
  </p>


  <h2>The function problem</h2>

  <p>
    We turn to the evaluation rule for functions.  In the substution model, function evaluation was
    quite simple: we evaluate a term $\backslash x : t \to e$ to the function $\lambda x. e$.
    However, now things are not so simple.  A function term $\backslash x : t \to e$ may itself
    contain free variables; in the environment model, those variables should be defined by the
    environment $H$.  However, the body of a function is not evaluated at the time it is defined,
    but at the time that it is used, at which point we may have a very different environment $H'$.
    For a (somewhat contrived) example, consider the following definition:
  </p>

  <pre>
let y = 3 in
let f = \ x : Int -> x + y in
let y = 4 in
  f 2 + y</pre>

  <p>
    In the substitution model, we start out by substitution <code>3</code> for <code>y</code>.
    Consequently, the body of function f is <code>\x : Int -> x + 3</code>, and the meaning of the
    entire term is <code>9</code>.  We would like the same to be true in the environment model, but
    that means we need to be clear that the <code>y</code> in <code>f</code> is not the
    same <code>y</code> as is visible at the call site.
  </p>

  <p>
    This might seem like just an issue of variable naming again; for example, in the above code,
    either <code>y</code> could be changed to another variable, like <code>z</code>, and the result
    would be unambiguous.  However, we can construct more interesting examples in which this does
    not suffice.  Convince yourself that the following example cannot be solved simply by renaming
    variables.
  </p>

  <pre>
let f = let y = 3 in
        \x : Int -> x + y in
let y = 4 in
  f 2 + y</pre>

  <p>
    To solve this problem, we need to be a little cleverer about the result of evaluting a function
    term.  Instead of evaluating a function term to just the parameter and the body, we need to also
    keep the environment in which the function was evaluated.  This combination of environment and
    function is called a <i>closure</i>, and the environment is called the <i>captured
    environment</i>.  We will write closures as $\Clos H x e$, denoting a function with parameter
    $x$, body $e$, and captured environment $H$.  We can now state evaluation rules that take
    closures into account.
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \frac{ }
         {\HEval H {\backslash x : t . e} {\Clos H  x e}}
    \qquad
    \frac{\HEval H {e_1} {\Clos {H'} x e} \quad
          \HEval H {e_2} w \quad
          \HEval {H', x \mapsto w} {e} v}
         {\HEval H {e_1 \, e_2} v}
  </script>

  <p>
    The evaluation rule for function terms now captures the environment $H$ and stores it in the
    resulting closure.  Similarly, the evaluation rule for application evaluates the function body
    (but not, of course, the argument) in the captured environment.  Convince yourself that these
    rules give the expected results for the examples above.
  </p>


  <h2>Dynamic scope</h2>

  <p>
    Historically, there is another approach to implementing functions.  In this approach, rather
    than capturing the environment when evaluating a function term, function bodies are evaluated in
    the environment in which they are used.  This is called <i>dynamic scope</i>, because the
    meaning of a variable is determined by the execution of the program rather than by its location
    in the source.  We could write evaluation rules for dynamic scoping as follows.
  </p>

  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
    \frac{ }
         {\HEval H {\backslash x : t . e} {\lambda x. e}}
    \qquad
    \frac{\HEval H {e_1} {\lambda x. e} \quad
          \HEval H {e_2} w \quad
          \HEval {H,x \mapsto w} e v}
         {\HEval H {e_1 \, e_2} v}
  </script>

  <p>
    Most immediately, dynamic scoping breaks the correspondence between our implementation of the
    &lambda;-calculus and the substitution model; it also breaks the connection bewteen typing and
    evaluation.  Convince yourself that the following two programs are well-typed, but cannot
    evaluate without errors.
  </p>

  <pre>
let f = let y = 3 in
        \x : Int -> x + y in
let y = 4 in
  f 2 + y</pre>

  <pre>
let f = \x : Int -> \y : Int -> x + y in
  f 1 2</pre>

  <p>
    So, it may be confusion why dynamic scoping was ever implemented in the first place.  However,
    there are strange benefits to dynamically scoped languages as well.  For example, they provide a
    way to achieve recursive definitions but without any explicit scope for recursion.  Consider the
    following definition and use of the factorial function:
  </p>

  <pre>
let fact = \n : Int -> if isz n then 1 else n * fact (n - 1) in
  fact 3</pre>

  <p>
    With static scope, this program cannot execute: the body of the function is executed in its
    captured environment, at which point <code>fact</code> is not defined.  However, with dynamic
    scope, this program executes fine; by the time the body of <code>fact</code> is
    executed, <code>fact</code> is itself defined.  You may wish to convince yourself of this:
    attempt to derive a value for <code>fact 2</code> with both static and dynamic scoping.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    The elegance of the &lambda;-calculus arises from how remarkably complex behavior can be
    specified using only very simple formal ideas, and substitution plays a central role in that
    story.  These notes have considered how we can implement substitution in practice, and gives
    some historical insight on alternative implementations.  While we can now see clearly that
    dynamic scoping is wrong, the correct implementation of static scoping was an open question in
    functional programming for much of the 1960s and 1970s.
