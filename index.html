  <h2>introduction</h2>
  <p>
    <em>I study the foundations of programming:</em> how we construct programs and
    how we reason about them.  My thesis is that advances in type systems empower programmers to
    create better-written, better-understood programs:
  </p>
  <ul class="inline">
    <li>
      <em>More precise type systems better characterize program behavior.</em> For example, I have
      studied the use of substructural type systems to guarantee lock freedom in concurrent
      programs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>More expressive type systems enable powerful, generic abstractions.</em>  For example, I have
      studied the use of qualified types to capture a uniform description of a variety of methods
      for composing records, variants, and program modules.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em>These advances form a virtuous cycle.</em>  More precise types enable better abstractions, while
    expressive abstractions make precise type systems easy to use.
  </p>

    <p class="abstract">
      This project develops new foundations for machine-verified proof in
      programming languages and mathematics. Formalized libraries of mathematics
      enable increased confidence in the correctness of proven results,
      large-scale collaboration on future results, and a database of relevant
      facts for automated reasoning. However, reuse of formalized proofs and
      proof components is made difficult by language limitations within theorem
      provers and incompatible choices between theorem provers. The project's
      novelty is a new foundational technique based on type theory, with formal
      tools for proof modularity and reuse at its core. The project's impacts
      are increased sharing among formalization efforts and a basis for more
      effectively exploring new proof theoretic foundations for mechanized
      theorem proving.

    <p class="abstract">
      The project's core contribution is a new impredicative dependent row type
      theory. Impredicativity captures expressive features of modern dependently
      typed languages, like induction-recursion, without further extension.
      Proof reuse is enabled by row types, used to describe extensible variants
      and extensible dependent records. Both object logics and constructs within
      them will be expressed extensible, automatically extending proof terms
      over simpler objects in smaller logics to apply to more complex terms in
      larger logics. For example, constructive proofs on groups can
      automatically be used as classical proofs on fields.

    <p class="abstract">
      Mathematics and computer science are inextricably linked. However, it is
      well-known among educators and education researchers that undergraduate
      computer scientists often do not appreciate the relevance of mathematics
      to their discipline. This disconnect adversely affects students,
      especially as they progress from concrete, practical introductory courses
      centered on programming to theoretical upper-level courses rooted in
      abstract mathematics. Researchers have observed that student performance
      in the classroom and retention within the major falter when these
      connections are not established. This project's impact is to address these
      concerns by developing pedagogy that (a) unites the mathematical
      foundations and practice of computer science together in a way that all
      undergraduates can appreciate and directly apply in their future endeavors
      and (b) is adoptable by as many institutions as possible, especially those
      with limited room to expand their curriculum.
    </p>

    <p class="abstract">
      To accomplish these goals, the investigators develop, deploy, and evaluate
      new pedagogy that integrates formal methods techniques within the existing
      undergraduate computer science curriculum. Specifically, this pedagogy
      introduces program reasoning, an activity all computer scientists perform,
      as the primary vehicle for studying the mathematical foundations of
      computing in the contexts of introductory programming, discrete
      mathematics, and algorithms courses. Such pedagogy bridges the gap between
      mathematics and computer science for all undergraduate computer scientists
      and makes relevant formal methods for a new generation of programmers.
      Additionally, the project promotes the relevance of formal methods to
      undergraduate computer science educators, as exemplified by this pedagogy,
      through a series of workshops at the regional and national levels.

    <p class="abstract">
      The project sits at the intersection of two important goals in practical
      and correct software development.  The first is precisely and formally
      capturing the requirements of programs and program components: we do not
      want a program to rely on comparing functions for equality, or adding
      arbitrary integers to pointers.  The second is modular and extensible
      program construction: program components must be developed independently,
      and changes internal to one component should not cause cascading changes
      to other components.  This project's novelties are: a new foundation for
      extensible descriptions of program properties and invariants, subsuming
      multiple competing and complementary features used in current languages;
      its impementation; and its metatheory.  The project's impacts are:
      regularizing and extending features for specifying program properties in
      existing languages; simplifying their implementation; and making these
      features practical for adoption in other languages.
    </p>

    <p class="abstract">
      The primary focus of this project is the programming language Haskell.
      Haskell has an advanced type system with several features for modular and
      extensible specification of program properties, most prominently type
      classes and type families.  These features have evolved mostly
      independently, with different approaches to their specification and
      implementation.  The result, for both programmers and implementers, is a
      constellation of features with frequently surprising interactions and
      limitations.  This project develops a new core language for Haskell, with
      a single feature that captures both type classes and type families.  It
      will simplify Haskell implementations and make the existing features of
      Haskell more regular and more expressive.  It will enable new features of
      Haskell, closing the gaps between type families and type classes. And, it
      will make it easier for other languages to adopt features from Haskell, by
      giving them a simpler underlying semantics.

    <p class="abstract">
      Modern software engineering relies on large ecosystems of independent
      software components and libraries. This poses two challenges for the
      design of programming languages and language tooling, both of which are
      addressed by this project. First, languages must support developing
      independent components, including identifying and abstracting reusable
      components from existing applications. Second, languages must provide
      expressive specification mechanisms to ensure that components are used
      correctly and that components do not have unintended interactions. The
      project's novelties are new programming language features for modular
      specification and implementation of program data and behavior, at all
      level of the software stack from user-facing applications to operating
      system components and hardware support. The project's impacts are
      improvements in both software reliability and programmer productivity, as
      the project enables language tooling to automatically help programmers
      identify and correctly use software components and libraries.
    </p>

    <p class="abstract">
      The project has two primary themes. The first is modularity and reuse in
      high-level functional programs. The project develops extensible types for
      data and computational effects, supporting high-level abstractions
      including overloading, generic programming, and extensible effect
      handlers. The second is modularity and reuse in low-level and systems
      programs. The project develops extensible bit-level specifications of data
      structures and their layout, targeting applications including operating
      system kernels and hardware interfaces. Each of these themes will only
      have impact if the resulting language features have comparable performance
      with existing approaches. The project uses linear typing and compile-type
      specialization to offset runtime costs traditionally associated with
      generic and extensible programming techniques.

 <div id="handling">
   <p class="abstract">
     We propose a novel approach to soundly combining linear types with multi-shot effect handlers. Linear type systems statically ensure that resources such as file handles and communication channels are used exactly once. Effect handlers provide a rich modular programming abstraction for implementing features ranging from exceptions to concurrency to backtracking. Whereas conventional linear type systems bake in the assumption that continuations are invoked exactly once, effect handlers allow continuations to be discarded (e.g. for exceptions) or invoked more than once (e.g. for backtracking). This mismatch leads to soundness bugs in existing systems such as the programming language Links, which combines linearity (for session types) with effect handlers. We introduce control-flow linearity as a means to ensure that continuations are used in accordance with the linearity of any resources they capture, ruling out such soundness bugs.
   </p>

   <p class="abstract">
     We formalise the notion of control-flow linearity in a System F-style core calculus F<sub>eff</sub><sup>∘</sup> equipped with linear types, an effect type system, and effect handlers. We define a linearity-aware semantics in order to formally prove that F<sub>eff</sub><sup>∘</sup> preserves the integrity of linear values in the sense that no linear value is discarded or duplicated. In order to show that control-flow linearity can be made practical, we adapt <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Links</span> based on the design of F<sub>eff</sub><sup>∘</sup>, in doing so fixing a long-standing soundness bug.
   </p>

   <p class="abstract">
     Finally, to better expose the potential of control-flow linearity, we define an ML-style core calculus Q<sub>eff</sub><sup>∘</sup>, based on qualified types, which requires no programmer provided annotations, and instead relies entirely on type inference to infer control-flow linearity. Both linearity and effects are captured by qualified types. Q<sub>eff</sub><sup>∘</sup> overcomes a number of practical limitations of F<sub>eff</sub><sup>∘</sup>, supporting abstraction over linearity, linearity dependencies between type variables, and a much more fine-grained notion of control-flow linearity.

    We present a novel approach to generic programming over extensible data
    types. Row types capture the structure of records and variants, and can be
    used to express record and variant subtyping, record extension, and modular
    composition of case branches. We extend row typing to capture generic
    programming over rows themselves, capturing patterns including lifting
    operations to records and variations from their component types, and the
    duality between cases blocks over variants and records of labeled functions,
    without placing specific requirements on the fields or constructors present
    in the records and variants. We formalize our approach in System R𝜔, an
    extension of F𝜔 with row types, and give a denotational semantics for

 <div id="divide">
  <p class="abstract">
    This paper proposes a new approach to writing and verifying
    divide-and-conquer programs in Coq. Extending the rich line of previous work
    on algebraic approaches to recursion schemes, we present an algebraic
    approach to divide-and-conquer recursion: recursions are represented as a
    form of algebra, and from outer recursions, one may initiate inner
    recursions that can construct data upon which the outer recursions may
    legally recurse. Termination is enforced entirely by the typing discipline
    of our recursion schemes. Despite this, our approach requires little from
    the underlying type system, and can be implemented in System Fω plus a
    limited form of positive-recursive types. Our implementation of the method
    in Coq does not rely on structural recursion or on dependent types. The
    method is demonstrated on several examples, including mergesort, quicksort,
    Harper’s regular-expression matcher, and others. An indexed version is also
    derived, implementing a form of divide-and-conquer induction that can be
    used to reason about functions defined via our method.

<div id="pip">
  <p class="abstract">
    Type constructors in functional programming languages are total: a Haskell
    programmer can equally readily construct lists of any element type. In
    practice, however, not all applications of type constructors are equally
    sensible: collections may only make sense for orderable elements, or
    embedded DSLs might only make sense for serializable return types. Jones et
    al. proposed a theory of partial type constructors, which guarantees that
    type applications are sensible, and extends higher-order abstractions to
    apply equally well to partial and total type constructors. This paper
    evaluates the practicality of partial type constructors, in terms of both
    language design and implementation. We extend GHC, the most widely used
    Haskell compiler, with support for partial type constructors, and test our
    extension on the compiler itself and its libraries. We show that introducing
    partial type constructors has a minimal impact on most code, but raises
    important questions in language and library design

     This paper introduces Hypersequent GV (HGV), a modular and extensible core calculus for functional programming with session types that enjoys deadlock freedom, confluence, and strong normalisation. HGV exploits hyper-environments, which are collections of type environments, to ensure that structural congruence is type preserving. As a consequence we obtain a tight operational correspondence between HGV and HCP, a hypersequent-based process-calculus interpretation of classical linear logic. Our translations from HGV to HCP and vice-versa both preserve and reflect reduction. HGV scales smoothly to support Girard's Mix rule, a crucial ingredient for channel forwarding and exceptions.

     certain choices of arguments. We present a language design and formal theory of partial type constructors,
     capturing the domains of type constructors using qualified types. Our design is both simple and expressive:
     we support partial datatypes as first-class citizens (including as instances of parametric abstractions, such as
     the Haskell Functor and Monad classes), and show a simple type elaboration algorithm that avoids placing
     undue annotation burden on programmers. We show that our type system rejects ill-defined types and can be
     compiled to a semantic model based on System F. Finally, we have conducted an experimental analysis of a
     body of Haskell code, using a proof-of-concept implementation of our system; while there are cases where
     our system requires additional annotations, these cases are rarely encountered in practical Haskell code.

     Process calculi based in logic, such as &pi;DILL and CP, provide a foundation for deadlock-free

     We present a novel typed language for extensible data types, generalizing and abstracting

     maintaining strong metatheoretic properties, such as coherence and principal types. Evidence

     Gradual typing has emerged as the tonic for programmers wanting a mixture of static and dynamic
     typing, hoping to achieve the best of both. Sound gradual typing is the most potent brew,
     providing static type- checking and dynamic assertions. Contracts provide a lightweight form of
     gradual typing as they do not provide static checking but can be implemented as a library,
     rather than demanding language level support.
   </p>

   <p class="abstract">
     Intersection and union types are well suited to dynamic languages: intersection encodes
     overloaded functions; union encodes uncertain data arising from branching code. We extend the
     untyped lambda calculus with contracts for monitoring higher-order intersection and union
     types, giving a uniform treatment to both.  Each operator requires a single reduction rule that
     does not depend on the constituent types, or the context of the operator, unlike existing work.

     We present a new method for defining contract satisfaction based on blame behaviour. A value

     using any value, never elicits negative blame.

   <p class="abstract">
     We supplement our definition of satisfaction with a serious of monitoring properties that
     satisfying values and continuations should have. Each type has a positive property for values

     Extensible variants improve the modularity and expressiveness of programming languages: they

     extension of existing code with both new cases of existing data types and new operations over
     those data types.
   </p>

   <p class="abstract">
     This paper considers three approaches to providing extensible variants in Haskell.  Row typing
     is a long understood mechanism for typing extensible records and variants, but its adoption
     would require extension of Haskell's core type system.  Alternatively, we might hope to encode
     extensible variants in terms of existing mechanisms, such as type classes.  We describe an
     encoding of extensible variants using instance chains, a proposed extension of the class
     system.  Unlike many previous encodings of extensible variants, ours does not require the
     definition of a new type class for each function that consumes variants.  Finally, we translate
     our encoding to use closed type families, an existing feature of GHC.  Doing so demonstrates
     the interpretation of instances chains and functional dependencies in closed type families.

   <p class="abstract">
     One concern with encodings like ours is how completely they match the encoded system.  We
     compare the expressiveness of our encodings with each other and with systems based on row
     types.  We find that, while equivalent terms are typable in each system, both encodings require
     explicit type annotations to resolve ambiguities in typing not present in row type systems, and
     the type family implementation retains more constraints in principal types than does the
     instance chain implementation.  We propose a general mechanism to guide the instantiation of
     ambiguous type variables, show that it eliminates the need for type annotations in our
     encodings, and discuss conditions under which it preserves coherence.

     Session types provide a static guarantee that concurrent programs respect communication
     protocols. Recently, Caires, Pfenning, and Toninho, and Wadler, have developed a correspondence
     between propositions of linear logic and session typed &#960;-calculus processes.

     We relate the cut-elimination semantics of this approach to an operational semantics for
     session-typed concurrency in a functional language.

     We begin by presenting a variant of Wadler's session-typed core functional language, GV. We
     give a small-step operational semantics for GV. We develop a suitable notion of deadlock, based
     on existing approaches for capturing deadlock in &#960;-calculus, and show that all well-typed
     GV programs are deadlock-free, deterministic, and terminating.

     We relate GV to linear logic by giving translations between GV and CP, a process calculus with
     a type system and semantics based on classical linear logic.  We prove that both directions of
     our translation preserve reduction; previous translations from GV to CP, in contrast, failed to
     preserve &#946;-reduction.

     Furthermore, to demonstrate the modularity of our approach, we define two extensions of GV

     As originally proposed, type classes provide overloading and ad-hoc definition, but can still

     subsequent extensions of type classes.  Functional dependencies and equality constraints allow
     the satisfiability of predicates to refine typing; this means that the interpretations of
     equivalent qualified types may not be interconvertible.  Overlapping instances and instance
     chains allow predicates to be satisfied without determining the implementations of their

     to the semantics of type classes, interpreting polymorphic expressions by the behavior of each

   <p class="abstract">
     Type classes, first proposed during the design of the Haskell programming language, extend
     standard type systems to support overloaded functions. Since their introduction, type classes
     have been used to address a range of problems, from typing ordering and arithmetic operators to
     describing heterogeneous lists and limited subtyping. However, while type class programming is
     useful for a variety of practical problems, its wider use is limited by the inexpressiveness
     and hidden complexity of current mechanisms. We propose two improvements to existing class
     systems. First, we introduce several novel language features, instance chains and explicit
     failure, that increase the expressiveness of type classes while providing more direct
     expression of current idioms. To validate these features, we have built an implementation of
     these features, demonstrating their use in a practical setting and their integration with type
     reconstruction for a Hindley-Milner type system.  Second, we define a set-based semantics for
     type classes that provides a sound basis for reasoning about type class systems, their
     implementations, and the meanings of programs that use them.

   <p class="abstract">
     Type classes have found a wide variety of uses in Haskell programs, from simple overloading of
     operators (such as equality or ordering) to complex invariants used to implement type-safe
     heterogeneous lists or limited subtyping.  Unfortunately, many of the richer uses of type
     classes require extensions to the class system that have been incompletely described in the
     research literature and are not universally accepted within the Haskell community.
   </p>

   <p class="abstract">
     This paper describes a new type class system, implemented in a prototype tool
     called <tt>ilab</tt>, that simplifies and enhances Haskell-style type-class programming.
     In <tt>ilab</tt>, we replace overlapping instances with a new feature, <i>instance chains</i>,
     allowing explicit alternation and failure in instance declarations.  We describe a technique
     for ascribing semantics to type class systems, relating classes, instances, and class
     constraints (such as kind signatures or functional dependencies) directly to a set-theoretic
     model of relations on types.  Finally, we give a semantics for <tt>ilab</tt> and describe its
     implementation.

 <div id="hackage">
   <p class="abstract">
     Hackage, an online repository of Haskell applications and libraries, provides a hub for
     programmers to both release code to and use code from the larger Haskell community.  We suggest
     that Hackage can also serve as a valuable resource for language designers: by providing a large
     collection of code written by different programmers and in different styles, it allows language
     designers to see not just how features could be used theoretically, but how they are (and are
     not) used in practice.
   </p>

   <p class="abstract">
     We were able to make such a use of Hackage during the design of the class system for a new
     Haskell-like programming language.  In this paper, we sketch our language design problem, and
     how we used Hackage to help answer it.  We describe our methodology in some detail, including
     both ways that it was and was not effective, and summarize our results.
