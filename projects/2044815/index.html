  <h2>abstract</h2>

  <p>
    Modern software engineering relies on large ecosystems of independent
    software components and libraries. This poses two challenges for the
    design of programming languages and language tooling, both of which are
    addressed by this project. First, languages must support developing
    independent components, including identifying and abstracting reusable
    components from existing applications. Second, languages must provide
    expressive specification mechanisms to ensure that components are used
    correctly and that components do not have unintended interactions. The
    project's novelties are new programming language features for modular
    specification and implementation of program data and behavior, at all
    level of the software stack from user-facing applications to operating
    system components and hardware support. The project's impacts are
    improvements in both software reliability and programmer productivity, as
    the project enables language tooling to automatically help programmers
    identify and correctly use software components and libraries.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project has two primary themes. The first is modularity and reuse in
    high-level functional programs. The project develops extensible types for
    data and computational effects, supporting high-level abstractions
    including overloading, generic programming, and extensible effect
    handlers. The second is modularity and reuse in low-level and systems
    programs. The project develops extensible bit-level specifications of data
    structures and their layout, targeting applications including operating
    system kernels and hardware interfaces. Each of these themes will only
    have impact if the resulting language features have comparable performance
    with existing approaches. The project uses linear typing and compile-type
    specialization to offset runtime costs traditionally associated with
    generic and extensible programming techniques.

  <div id="handling">
    <p class="abstract">
      We propose a novel approach to soundly combining linear types with multi-shot effect handlers. Linear type systems statically ensure that resources such as file handles and communication channels are used exactly once. Effect handlers provide a rich modular programming abstraction for implementing features ranging from exceptions to concurrency to backtracking. Whereas conventional linear type systems bake in the assumption that continuations are invoked exactly once, effect handlers allow continuations to be discarded (e.g. for exceptions) or invoked more than once (e.g. for backtracking). This mismatch leads to soundness bugs in existing systems such as the programming language Links, which combines linearity (for session types) with effect handlers. We introduce control-flow linearity as a means to ensure that continuations are used in accordance with the linearity of any resources they capture, ruling out such soundness bugs. 
    </p>
 
    <p class="abstract">
      We formalise the notion of control-flow linearity in a System F-style core calculus F<sub>eff</sub><sup>‚àò</sup> equipped with linear types, an effect type system, and effect handlers. We define a linearity-aware semantics in order to formally prove that F<sub>eff</sub><sup>‚àò</sup> preserves the integrity of linear values in the sense that no linear value is discarded or duplicated. In order to show that control-flow linearity can be made practical, we adapt <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Links</span> based on the design of F<sub>eff</sub><sup>‚àò</sup>, in doing so fixing a long-standing soundness bug. 
    </p>
 
    <p class="abstract">
      Finally, to better expose the potential of control-flow linearity, we define an ML-style core calculus Q<sub>eff</sub><sup>‚àò</sup>, based on qualified types, which requires no programmer provided annotations, and instead relies entirely on type inference to infer control-flow linearity. Both linearity and effects are captured by qualified types. Q<sub>eff</sub><sup>‚àò</sup> overcomes a number of practical limitations of F<sub>eff</sub><sup>‚àò</sup>, supporting abstraction over linearity, linearity dependencies between type variables, and a much more fine-grained notion of control-flow linearity.

   <p class="abstract">
     We present a novel approach to generic programming over extensible data
     types. Row types capture the structure of records and variants, and can be
     used to express record and variant subtyping, record extension, and modular
     composition of case branches. We extend row typing to capture generic
     programming over rows themselves, capturing patterns including lifting
     operations to records and variations from their component types, and the
     duality between cases blocks over variants and records of labeled functions,
     without placing specific requirements on the fields or constructors present
     in the records and variants. We formalize our approach in System Rùúî, an
     extension of Fùúî with row types, and give a denotational semantics for
     (stratified) Rùúî in Agda.
